# restaurant-page

### Description

This purpose of this project was to exercise my knowledge in Webpack, npm and ES6 modules. I used webpack to bundle all of my files and assets along with webpack-dev-server for my development work flow.

The website itself is for a fictional restaurant called "Midnight Milk". I took inspiration from Isomnia Cookies for the theming, but the website itself is a bit random.
